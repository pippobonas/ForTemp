    "|--------|-------|------------|\n",
    "|2m temperature|\tK|\tThis parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.|\n",
    "|10m u-component of wind|\tm s-1|\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.|\n",
    "|10m v-component of wind\t|m s-1\t|This parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.|\n",
    "|Mean sea level pressure\t|Pa\t|This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).|\n",
    "|Surface pressure|\tPa\t|This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of land, sea and inland water. It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure weather systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb= 100 Pa).|\n",
    "|Surface solar radiation downwards\t|J m-2\t|This parameter is the amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) that reaches a horizontal plane at the surface of the Earth. This parameter comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this parameter). To a reasonably good approximation, this parameter is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours ending at the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.|\n",
    "|Total Cloud Cover|Dimensionless|This parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud. Total cloud cover is a single level field calculated from the cloud occurring at different model levels through the atmosphere. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds at different heights. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.|\n",
